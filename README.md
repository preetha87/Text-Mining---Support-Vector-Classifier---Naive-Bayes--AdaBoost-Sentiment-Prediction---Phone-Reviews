# Text-Mining---Support-Vector-Classifier---Naive-Bayes--AdaBoost-Sentiment-Prediction---Phone-Reviews
The data comprised of 100,000 user reviews of smartphones or their accessories, scraped from multiple websites. The task was to use a Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifer and a Tree-Based Ensemble Classifier to predict whether users will recommend products to others or not. Models were created under the following scenarios: 1. Only unigrams are used as tokens, which must occur in at least 10 documents. 2. Unigrams and Bigrams are used as tokens, which must occur in at least 20 documents. 3. Unigrams, Bigrams and Trigrams are used as tokens, which must occur in at least 30 documents.
